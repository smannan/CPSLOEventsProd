<h1> Welcome to CPSLO Events! </h1>

<pre>
This website was created by four students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
Use this website to create events, invite other users to events you create, 
and RSVP to events.

If you have an account log in, otherwise get started by registering. 

Once you're set up, you can navigate to all events to see all events that are 
open to the public, or events you have been invited to. Filter events you are 
interested in by start/end date, zip code, or organizer email. Click on the event 
to go to the event page, where you can see who has been invited and what their 
RSVP status is. 



Navigate to your events to view events you have created. If you are the organizer
of an event, you can edit the event details such as address, date, or description.
You can also go to the event page to invite more users or delete
users from the invitee list. 
Navigate to your reservations to change your reservation status for an event 
as well as view which events you have RSVP'd to and what your status is.
