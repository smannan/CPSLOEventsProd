<h1> Welcome to CPSLO Events! </h1>
<p> 	This website was created by four students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
<br> 	Use this website to create events, invite other users, and RSVP to events. </br>
<br> 	If you have an account log in, otherwise get started by registering. </br>
<br>	Once you're set up, you can navigate to all events to see all events that are </br>
<br>	open to the public, or events you have been invited to. Filter events you are </br>
<br>	interested in by start/end date, zip code, or organizer email. Click on the event </br>
<br> 	to go to the event page, where you can see who has been invited and what their </br>
<br> 	RSVP status is. </br>
</p>

<p> 	Navigate to your events to view events you have created. If you are the organizer</p>
<p>		of an event, you can edit the event details such as address, date, or description.</p>
<p>		You can also go to the event page to invite more users or delete</p>
<p>		users from the invitee list. </p>
<p> 	Navigate to your reservations to change your reservation status for an event </p>
<p>		as well as view which events you have RSVP'd to and what your status is. </p>
